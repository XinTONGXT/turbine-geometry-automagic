Example

First of all, make sure TGAM.py is in a directory which is part of PYTHONPATH.

All .txt files contain x,y coordinates of different blade cross sections. These were obtained from JavaFoil (from http://www.mh-aerotools.de/airfoils/javafoil.htm). Moreover, they were saved in a way such that their filenames allowed for sorting them.

The file "make-soho-tidal-turbine.py" contains user specified settings to generate the turbine(s), e.g. filenames of the blade cross sections, radius of the hub, height of the hub, number of blades, pitch angles, spin direction, and even option for the meshing. Theses options are currently required to be set in a python file, such as "make-soho-tidal-turbine.py", and are then passed to TGAM.

Running "make-soho-tidal-turbine.py" through Python, if everything works out fine, results in a file called "soho_aerof01_naca_4826_31point-3D.py". This can then be run through Cubit's Python interface to generate the geometry and mesh of the specified turbine.
